A personal assistant.

.idea and PyCharm files are solely for my IDE, they have nothing to do with the actual application.

How it works:
The interaction with the user is done in the interface.py file, which sends user input to the brain.py file to be processed. The processed data is then sent back and is output to the user.

How to use:
Run the interface.py file.

NOTE:
Still in very early stages of development.
