A personal assistant.

Note
----
This was a test project from my early Python days that I keep on Github for my amusement. Please don't judge me.

How it works:
------------
The interaction with the user is done in the interface.py file, which sends user input to the brain.py file to be processed. The processed data is then sent back and is output to the user.

How to use:
----------
Run the interface.py file.

Current capabilities:
--------------------
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Outputs floats.<br>
Examples:<br>
what is 40 divided by 10<br>
==> 40.0 / 10.0 = 4.0<br>
<br>
10.1 multiplied by 10<br>
==> 10.1 * 10.0 = 101.0
